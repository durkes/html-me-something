      <h4>Population</h4>
      <p>
        Kansas City is the largest city in Missouri, United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had an estimated population of <strong>481,420</strong> in 2016, making it the 37th largest city by population in the United States. It is the central city of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the Kansasâ€“Missouri border. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a Missouri River port at its confluence with the Kansas River coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850 the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory. Confusion between the two ensued and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon thereafter.
